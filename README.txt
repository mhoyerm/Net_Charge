Net Charge
 
For each protein, calculates the net charge in stretches of 30 amino acids. If the net charge of the stretch is less or equal than the maximum charge value allowed, which is +14, the name of the protein and the stretches are written in the output file.
 
Usage:
net_charge.py <example.fasta> <output_example>
input (required): Input complete file name as for example "example.fasta"
output (required): Output file name, it generates "output_example.txt"

The input is a uniprot.fasta archive obtained from https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/
